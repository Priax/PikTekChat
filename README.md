A little program I did using Rust and SDL2

I made it on Fedora Linux so I don't know if it works on other OS/Distros<br>
You also need to install rust to run it, use <code>Cargo run</code> to run it ! <br>
(You might need to install the sdl2-rust library first)

It's a drawing program which draws using a line made out of circles, you can :

- Save an image (using F)
- Open an image (using O)
- Clear current layer (using X)
- Remove current layer (assuming you have more than one, R)
- Add a layer (A)
- Move to next or previous layer (using N or P)
- Increase / Decrease pencil size (using I or D)
- Make the current layer visible or not (using V)
- Resize / Close your window

If you save and a layer is not visible, it won't be saved !
Also, the saved image will take the size of your current window.

Feel free to try it !
I had a lot of fun making it, even though it's not perfect.
